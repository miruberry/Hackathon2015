## Overview
We proposed a new machine-learning algorithm to simulate the developmental process of place cells, which perform place recognition (one of the core functions of hippocampus). We trained an artificial place cell using this algorithm, and demonstrate its ability by solving maze task in an efficient manner.

## Notes about code availavility
At the moment, we do not push our code to this repository because we are planning to publish our achievements in WBAI Hackathon 2015. The code and detailed description will be available in this repository after our paper is accepted to a journal.
